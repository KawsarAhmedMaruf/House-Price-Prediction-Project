This project focuses on predicting house prices and involves the use of various techniques to handle missing values and reduce dimensionality. The dataset used contains a large number of features and missing values. 

To handle the missing values, different technique is employed. 

For dimensionality reduction, the project utilizes the SelectFromModel function from the sklearn library. This function selects the best features based on a machine learning model's importance scores and helps reduce the number of features to the top 21 in this case. 

The project involves the use of various machine learning models for the house price prediction task. The specific models employed are not listed in the given code, but some commonly used models for regression tasks include linear regression, random forest, decision tree, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, AdaBoost, bagging, and gradient boosting. These models are likely trained and evaluated for their performance on the house price prediction task.

Additionally, the project utilizes graphical visualization tools to analyze the dataset and identify patterns. Some of the visualization techniques employed include scatter plots to understand relationships between variables and a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features.

Overall, the project demonstrates the application of different techniques for handling missing values, reducing dimensionality, and employing various machine learning models for house price prediction.
